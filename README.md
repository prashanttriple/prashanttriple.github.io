### FAQ:

#### Q) How do you define "Value"?
  A) "Value" = Significantly Underpriced Listing AND High Quality Property 

#### Q) What does "Significantly Underpriced" Mean?
  A) Our pricing model estimates the fair value of a property today based on price trends, recent sales, characteristics of the property, geo data, economic trends to name a few covariates. It also estimates a range based on the uncertainty of the fair value price. "Significantly Underpriced" is defined as below the lower threshold of a properties lowest raange of price by a standard deviation. 
  
#### Q) What does "Quality" Mean?
  A) In April-May of 2020, the Data Science team at Triplemint understood that there would be a "Flight to Quality: FTQ" for Buyers who wanted more certainty about purchasing a property that was more likely to retain the principal if the recession was to expand to the housing market. Therefore we developed the FTQ model that identifed the types of properties that are more likely to sell for more during a housing recession using historical data on the 08-09 housing recession and effects in NYC as training data. Our model identifies quality properties that have the right characterisitcs to better weather a housing recession.
  
#### Q) Why is this important now?
  A) In April, our estimation was that Sellers would react slower compared to Buyers in their price expectations. Sellers are now reacting the changing market and the resulting expansion in listings have softened prices. This is the right time for Buyers to pick up deals, but not every underpriced property is the same deal.
  
#### Q) Result: Value = Underpriced AND High Quality:
  A) We therefore define "Value" as properties listed today significantly underpriced and of high quality : that is properties below the normal range of price and of the type that we estimate better able to withstand a housing recession, should it come. 

#### Q) How many properties are in the initial model results
  A) Just over half the condo and coop properties listed today have results
